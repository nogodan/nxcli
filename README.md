1. You can get cluster detail such as ntp,dns,data service IP address

2. You will see all hostnames  and their uuid first then if you provide uuid, will get host detail for the host

3. All VM list will be shown with their name,uuid,power status, will get VM detail if you provide uuid 

4. All image list will be shown with their name,uuid, vm_disk_id, will get image detail if you provide uuid 

5. All container list will be shown with their name,uuid, will get container detail if you provide uuid 

6. All network list will be shown with their name,uuid, will get network detail if you provide uuid 

7.Upload image from URL only for now - require container uuid to upload

8. You can create new VM from disk image from image service with cloud-init config file
   cloud-init file needs to be located in the same folder with nxcli file

9. You can transit VM power status by providing VM uuid

10. You can delete VM by providing VM uuid (cvm won't be deleted by this call but don't try in production)

11. You can collect performance data - cpu/mem for the host or vm max 4 hr historical data, min 30 sec polling period.

12. All disk list will be listed with detail info.
